Space Spin is my short solo project where you have interactive UI and 3D canvas 
with a planet surrounded by a wireframed version of the Sphere,
The Spehere and the wireframe both change colors as well as position when dragged with mouse
Always slowly spinning
```

### Adding 3D elements
```
to your web design is a great way to create a memorable, 
interactive experience, and with modern no-code web design tools itâ€™s now 
more accessible than ever before.

### 3D modeling
```
is used in various industries like films, animation and gaming, interior
designing and architecture. 3D allows you to create scenes of tremendous realism. 
And in recent games and films, computer-generated objects are combined with 
photographic backgrounds to further heighten the illusion. You can see the amazing 
results when you compare photographs and computer-generated scenes.
```

### Flat design once dominated the web
```
Its standard grids of text and visuals certainly 
make it a practical and user-friendly approach, but web design can be so much more 
than a well-intentioned arrangement of columns and rows.
